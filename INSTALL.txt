# INSTALL #

Prerequisites: 

- Oracle JDK 1.8 
- Maven 3

## To fully build and test the project execute: ##

    mvn -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -B -f reactor install && ./gradlew check

This builds the «reactor» project and installs its artefacts into local Maven repository. Then the regular Gradle build is launched. Further launches of Gradle can be done without running the build in «reactor». 

## To install all the dependencies in order to open the project with MPS: ##

    mvn -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -B -f reactor install && ./gradlew init

Once the project is opened, execute «Rebuild», since generated artefacts are excluded from version control

**NOTE: ** in order to open any of the sample projects follow the steps above for building the whole project, as samples expect the compiled languages to be available in a project library.
