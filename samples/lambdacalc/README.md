# Type Checking Lambda Calculus

This is a demo of type checking simply typed lambda calculus using constraint rules.

This project is made with [JetBrains MPS](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/) using *coderules* experimental extension.

Details of implementation can be found in the [article](https://github.com/fisakov/typechecking-lambdacalc) available online.

### Installation

The code in this project relies on *coderules* languages and solutions to be available, either as a project library or as a plugin. There are two possibilities to install coderules:

1. Follow the instructions for building the root project, or
2. Install the compiled plugin (see the latest release on GitHub).
