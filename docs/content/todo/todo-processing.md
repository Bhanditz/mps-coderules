    - [ ] committed choice
    - [ ] embeddable
    - [ ] call back to Java
    - [ ] 
- [x] Terms
    - [x] abstract data structure
    - [x] keeping arbitrary POJO
    - [x] unification
        - [ ] **example of finding MGU with unification**
- [x] Logical variables
    - [x] monotonic
    - [x] Terms with logical vars
    - [x] unification binds logicals
    - [x] logicals are observable
        - [x] parent observer
        - [x] value observer
- [x] Constraints and predicates
    - [x] What is a constraint. 
        - [x] constraint lifecycle
        - [ ] **constraint store**
    - [x] Constraint arguments.
        - [x] POJO
        - [x] Term
        - [x] Logical vars
        - [ ] **constraint observes its arguments**
    - [x] what is a predicate
        - [x] tell / ask
        - [ ] **unification example**
            - [ ] ask - test if unification succeeds (logical context)
            - [ ] tell - unify terms, assign logicals, re-activate constraints
- [ ] Constraint production (constraint rule)
    - [x] kept constraints vs. replaced constraints
        - [x] simplification/propagation/simpagation
    - [ ] condition for firing a production
        - [ ] on start - how itâ€™s actually implemented (main)
    - [ ] automatic binding of logicals on firing
        - [ ] pattern matching
    - [ ] guard condition
        - [ ] predicates
            - [ ] arbitrary java code
    - [ ] body
        - [ ] predicates
            - [ ] arbitrary java code
        - [ ] alternative body
    - [ ] handlers
        - [ ] order of productions within a handler
- [ ] Processing a constraint
    - [ ] one active constraint at any moment
    - [ ] productions selected top-to-bottom
    - [ ] aux constraints from store

    - [ ] partial rollback (alternative body)
    - [ ] observable logicals reactivate constraints
    - [ ] matched head binds logicals
